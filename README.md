Investment details:
1. Interest rate is R % per year.
2. A borrower should return his debt as fixed payment each month. Monthly payment doesn't
change each month and represents the sum of two components: part of initial principal and
interest amount.
3. Interest amount is calculated on the outstanding principal amount.
4. Investment duration is N years (it means last refund payment should be done in N years
after making the investment)

The task:
Write a module (i.e. several functions with same prefix) that takes: Agreement date, Calculation
date, X, R and N as input data and calculates Sum of all future interest payments.
Code requirements/restrictions:

• You can use any programming language you familiar with (but APL/C# is a plus)

• The code should follow maintainability principals.

• There should be well defined single-entry point (interface) in the code that takes input
argument and returns the result.
